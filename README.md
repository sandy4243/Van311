## Project Title:
“Improving Vancouver’s 311 Service Efficiency Using Data Analytics”


## Problem Statement:
Vancouver’s 311 system is a vital resource for residents to report issues, seek information, and request city services. Despite its importance, there are potential inefficiencies in handling service requests, managing inquiries, and tracking contact center performance. With growing demand, it’s crucial to analyze these datasets to uncover patterns, identify service bottlenecks, and recommend improvements to optimize response times, resource allocation, and service quality.
